# 🔧 Fixes Applied to Gene Expression Analysis App

## 🚨 Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. Data Loading Dimension Mismatch Error
**Issue**: `Length of values (72) does not match length of index (75)`

**Root Cause**: 
- Gene expression data had 38 samples (after filtering call columns)
- Labels file had 72 patient entries
- Direct assignment was failing due to dimension mismatch

**Solution Applied**:
- ✅ Implemented proper patient ID matching between datasets
- ✅ Added automatic data alignment based on common patient IDs
- ✅ Enhanced error handling with informative messages
- ✅ Added data inspection tools for debugging

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Before: Direct assignment (failed)
expression_data['label'] = labels_df['cancer'].values

# After: Smart matching by patient ID
expression_sample_ids = set(expression_data.index)
label_patient_ids = set(labels_df['patient'])
common_ids = expression_sample_ids.intersection(label_patient_ids)
# Filter both datasets to common IDs and align properly
```

### 2. Column Extraction Logic Error
**Issue**: Expression columns were not being extracted correctly from the alternating data/call pattern

**Root Cause**:
- Data format: `1, call, 2, call, 3, call, ...`
- Previous logic: `[col for col in columns if not col.endswith('call')]`
- This failed because some columns were named like `call.1`, `call.2`, etc.

**Solution Applied**:
- ✅ Implemented proper even/odd index filtering
- ✅ Correctly extracts expression values while skipping call columns

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Before: Incorrect filtering
expression_cols = [col for col in gene_data.columns if not col.endswith('call')]

# After: Proper index-based filtering
expression_cols = []
for i, col in enumerate(gene_data.columns):
    if i % 2 == 0:  # Even indices are expression values
        expression_cols.append(col)
```

### 3. Syntax Error in PCA Analysis Section
**Issue**: `SyntaxError: invalid syntax` at line 693

**Root Cause**:
- Incorrect indentation in the PCA analysis section
- `else` statement not properly aligned with its corresponding `if`
- Missing proper code block structure

**Solution Applied**:
- ✅ Fixed indentation throughout the PCA analysis section
- ✅ Properly structured the if/else blocks
- ✅ Ensured all visualization code is within the success condition

### 4. Try-Except Block Structure Error
**Issue**: `SyntaxError: expected 'except' or 'finally' block`

**Root Cause**:
- Incomplete try-except structure in t-SNE analysis
- Code after `try` block was not properly indented

**Solution Applied**:
- ✅ Fixed indentation in t-SNE analysis section
- ✅ Properly structured the try-except blocks
- ✅ Ensured all analysis code is within the try block
